## Clause Parser

A clause is some text interspersed with `tags`. __Tags__ are placeholders, which will get their 
values when the clause is created. Tags are specified as __`[name: value]`__

Here's some sample clause with tags:

```text
The weather at [city: City] is [temp: Temperature][unit: TemperatureUnit]
```
